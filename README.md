# ROC-GLM and Calibration for DataSHIELD

The package provides functionality to conduct and visualize ROC analysis
and calibration on decentralized data. The basis is the
[DataSHIELD](https://www.datashield.org/) infrastructure for distributed
computing. This package provides the calculation of the
[**ROC-GLM**](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2676973?seq=1) with [**AUC
confidence intervals**](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2531595?seq=1) as
well as [**calibration
curves**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/calibration-curves/) and the
[**Brier score**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score). In order
to calculate the ROC-GLM or assess calibration it is necessary to push
models and predict them at the servers which is also provided by this
package. Note that DataSHIELD uses [privacy
filter](https://data2knowledge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSDEV/pages/714768398/Disclosure+control)
from DataSHIELD v5 onwards that are also used in this package.
Additionally, this package uses the old option `datashield.privacyLevel`
(to indicate the minimal amount of values required to allow sharing an
aggregation) as fallback. Instead of setting the option, we directly
retrieve the fallback privacy level from the
[`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/difuture-lmu/dsBinVal/blob/master/DESCRIPTION)
file each time a function calls for it. This options is set to 5 by
default. The methodology of the package is explained in detail
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10828).

## Installation

At the moment, there is no CRAN version available. Install the
development version from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("difuture-lmu/dsBinVal")
```

#### Register methods

It is necessary to register the assign and aggregate methods in the OPAL
administration. These methods are registered automatically when
publishing the package on OPAL (see
[`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/difuture-lmu/dsBinVal/blob/main/DESCRIPTION)).

Note that the package needs to be installed at both locations, the
server and the analysts machine.

## Installation on DataSHIELD

The two options are to use the Opal API:

- Log into Opal ans switch to the `Administration/DataSHIELD/` tab
- Click the `Add DataSHIELD package` button
- Select `GitHub` as source, and use `difuture-lmu` as user, `dsBinVal`
  as name, and `main` as Git reference.

The second option is to use the `opalr` package to install `dsBinVal`
directly from `R`:

``` r
### User credentials (here from the opal test server):
surl     = "https://opal-demo.obiba.org/"
username = "administrator"
password = "password"

### Install package and publish methods:
opal = opalr::opal.login(username = username, password = password, url = surl)

opalr::dsadmin.install_github_package(opal = opal, pkg = "dsBinVal", username = "difuture-lmu", ref = "main")
opalr::dsadmin.publish_package(opal = opal, pkg = "dsBinVal")

opalr::opal.logout(opal)
```

## Usage

A more sophisticated example is available
[here](https://github.com/difuture-lmu/datashield-roc-glm-demo).

``` r
library(dsBinVal)
```

#### Log into DataSHIELD server

``` r
builder = newDSLoginBuilder()

surl     = "https://opal-demo.obiba.org/"
username = "administrator"
password = "password"

builder$append(
  server   = "ds1",
  url      = surl,
  user     = username,
  password = password,
  table    = "CNSIM.CNSIM1"
)
builder$append(
  server   = "ds2",
  url      = surl,
  user     = username,
  password = password,
  table    = "CNSIM.CNSIM2"
)
builder$append(
  server   = "ds3",
  url      = surl,
  user     = username,
  password = password,
  table    = "CNSIM.CNSIM3"
)

connections = datashield.login(logins = builder$build(), assign = TRUE)
#> 
#> Logging into the collaborating servers
#> 
#>   No variables have been specified. 
#>   All the variables in the table 
#>   (the whole dataset) will be assigned to R!
#> 
#> Assigning table data...
```

#### Load test model, push to DataSHIELD, and calculate predictions

``` r
# Load the model fitted locally on CNSIM:
load(here::here("Readme_files/mod.rda"))
# Model was calculated by:
#> glm(DIS_DIAB ~ ., data = CNSIM, family = binomial())

# Push the model to the DataSHIELD servers:
pushObject(connections, mod)
#> [2023-02-10 14:39:27] Your object is bigger than 1 MB (5.75186157226562 MB). Uploading larger objects may take some time.

# Create a clean data set without NAs:
ds.completeCases("D", newobj = "D_complete")
#> $is.object.created
#> [1] "A data object <D_complete> has been created in all specified data sources"
#> 
#> $validity.check
#> [1] "<D_complete> appears valid in all sources"

# Calculate scores and save at the servers:
pfun =  "predict(mod, newdata = D, type = 'response')"
predictModel(connections, mod, "pred", "D_complete", predict_fun = pfun)

datashield.symbols(connections)
#> $ds1
#> [1] "D"          "D_complete" "mod"        "pred"      
#> 
#> $ds2
#> [1] "D"          "D_complete" "mod"        "pred"      
#> 
#> $ds3
#> [1] "D"          "D_complete" "mod"        "pred"
```

#### Calculate l2-sensitivity

``` r
# In order to securely calculate the ROC-GLM, we have to assess the
# l2-sensitivity to set the privacy parameters of differential
# privacy adequately:
l2s = dsL2Sens(connections, "D_complete", "pred")
l2s
#> [1] 0.001475989

# Due to the results presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10828, we set the privacy parameters to
# - epsilon = 0.2, delta = 0.1 if        l2s <= 0.01
# - epsilon = 0.3, delta = 0.4 if 0.01 < l2s <= 0.03
# - epsilon = 0.5, delta = 0.3 if 0.03 < l2s <= 0.05
# - epsilon = 0.5, delta = 0.5 if 0.05 < l2s <= 0.07
# - epsilon = 0.5, delta = 0.5 if 0.07 < l2s BUT results may be not good!
```

#### Calculate ROC-GLM

``` r
# The response must be encoded as integer/numeric vector:
ds.asInteger("D_complete$DIS_DIAB", "truth")
#> $is.object.created
#> [1] "A data object <truth> has been created in all specified data sources"
#> 
#> $validity.check
#> [1] "<truth> appears valid in all sources"
roc_glm = dsROCGLM(connections, truth_name = "truth", pred_name = "pred",
  dat_name = "D_complete", seed_object = "pred")
#> 
#> [2023-02-10 14:41:25] L2 sensitivity is: 0.0015
#>
